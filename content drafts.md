## Proposed projects

- Simple Chatbot: In this project, students will create a chatbot that can respond to user input. They can use Python's NLTK library to parse natural language input and generate appropriate responses. The chatbot could be themed around a particular topic, such as a sports team or a hobby.

- Sentiment Analysis: Students can use Python's TextBlob library to perform sentiment analysis on a set of tweets or other text. They can then create a visualization that shows the overall sentiment, such as a bar chart or word cloud.

- Data Visualization: In this project, students will use Python's Matplotlib library to create visualizations of various data sets, such as weather data or sports statistics. They can choose from a variety of chart types, such as bar charts, line charts, and scatter plots.

- Image Manipulation: With Python's Pillow library, students can write code to manipulate images, such as resizing, cropping, or adding filters. They can use this to create a fun image editing program, such as a meme generator.

- Game Development: Students can use the Pygame library to create their own games, such as a 'moon landing' or a 'maze runner' game. They can use basic programming concepts like loops and conditionals to control game mechanics and create a fun gaming experience.

- More
    - Grade Calculator: Create a program that calculates grades based on assignments, quizzes, and exams. The program should take input from the user, calculate the grade, and output the final grade.
    - Hangman Game: Create a simple Hangman game that randomly selects a word and allows the user to guess letters until they solve the word or run out of guesses.
    - Number Guessing Game: Create a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess the number. The program should tell the user if their guess is too high or too low and keep track of the number of guesses.
    - Rock Paper Scissors Game: Create a simple Rock Paper Scissors game that allows the user to play against the computer. The program should keep track of the user's wins and losses.
    - Data Analysis of a CSV file: Find a CSV file with some data on the web and write a Python program that analyzes the data. For example, a CSV file containing sales data, student grades, or weather data could be analyzed.
    - Twitter Sentiment Analysis: Collect data from Twitter using the Twitter API and analyze the sentiment of tweets on a particular topic. This could involve using a Python library like tweepy, pandas, and TextBlob.
    - Image recognition: Use Python and OpenCV to build an image recognition system. For example, the program can recognize faces, animals, or objects.
    - Music genre classification: Use Python and machine learning to classify music genres based on the features of the music. This could involve using a Python library like librosa, scikit-learn, and pandas.
