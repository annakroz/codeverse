## How internet works

The internet is a giant network that connects millions of computers all over the world. 
It's like a huge web of interconnected spiderwebs, where each computer or device is a point 
on one of the webs. These computers or devices talk to each other to share information, like messages, pictures, videos, and more.

Here's a simple way to explain how the internet works using an example:

Imagine you want to send a letter to your friend who lives in another city. 
To send the letter, you would need to write your message, put it in an envelope, write your friend's address on it, and then give it to the post office. The post office then sends the letter to your friend's city, where it's delivered to their mailbox.

The internet works in a similar way. When you want to send a message or visit a website, your computer or device (like a phone or tablet) acts like the mailbox. Instead of writing a letter, you type a message or a website address. Your computer then takes that message or request and puts it into a digital envelope called a "packet."

These packets have a special address on them, which is called an IP address. Just like your friend's address on your letter, the IP address tells the internet where to send the packet.

To deliver your packet, your computer sends it through a series of devices called routers. You can think of routers as the post offices of the internet. They help move packets from one place to another, making sure they reach their destination.

Once your packet reaches its destination, the receiving computer or device opens it, reads the message or request, and then sends back a response. This might be a message saying your email was delivered or the information from the website you wanted to visit.

So, the internet works by sending lots of digital envelopes (packets) between computers and devices all over the world, allowing us to share information and communicate with each other quickly and easily.


## What is `Dub, Dub, Dub`?

The World Wide Web, or WWW, is a part of the internet that makes it easy for us to access and share information using websites and web pages. Think of the internet as a giant library and the WWW as the bookshelves filled with books. Each book represents a website, and the pages inside the books are web pages.

To better understand how the WWW works, let's break it down into a few key parts:

Web browsers: Web browsers, like Chrome, Safari, or Firefox, are like a pair of glasses that help you read the books in the library. They allow you to see the information on websites by turning computer code into something we can read, watch, or listen to.

URLs: A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is like the book's title and call number in the library. It's a unique address that helps you find the website you're looking for on the internet. For example, "www.example.com" is a URL that points to a specific website.

Web servers: Web servers are special computers that store the websites (books) and their web pages (pages inside the books). When you type a URL into your web browser, your browser sends a request to the web server to get the information you want. The server then sends the information back to your browser, which displays it on your screen.

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: These are computer languages used to create websites and web pages. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is like the words and sentences in a book, providing the main content. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is like the book's design, controlling the colors, fonts, and layout. JavaScript is like interactive elements, such as animations or quizzes, that make the pages more interactive and dynamic.

So, the World Wide Web works by using web browsers to find and display websites and web pages stored on web servers. It uses special computer languages, like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to create the content and design we see on our screens. The WWW makes it easy for us to find and share information on the internet, just like a library helps us find and read books.

## What happens when we browse websites?

When you want to visit a website, your browser (like Chrome, Safari, or Firefox) needs to talk to the computer that stores the website's information (the web server). The interaction between your browser and the web server can be broken down into a few simple steps:

1. Find the server. When you type a website address (like www.example.com) into your browser, it needs to find the web server that has the information for that website. Your browser does this by looking up the server's IP address, which is a unique set of numbers that identifies the server on the internet.

2. Connect to the server. Once your browser knows the server's IP address, it establishes a connection with the server. This is like making a phone call â€“ your browser "calls" the server to start a conversation.
3. Ask for information. Your browser sends a request to the web server, asking for the specific information you want to see, like a web page, an image, or a video.

4. Get the information. The web server processes your request and sends the information back to your browser.

5. Display the information. Your browser receives the information from the server and shows it on your screen.

This process happens very quickly, often in just a few seconds. 
The important thing to remember is that your browser and the web server work together to find, send, and display the information you want to see on the internet. 
This protocol is called HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.)

### Let's dive deeper and look under the hood of HTTP. 

HTTP is a set of rules that defines how messages (requests and responses) should be formatted and sent over the internet. 

Let's take an example to illustrate how it works. We'll use a computer terminal and command line tool called `curl`. This tool allows you to send HTTP requests and view the responses directly from your command prompt or terminal.

```shell
curl -v http://www.example.com
```

When you run this command in your terminal or command prompt, you'll see output similar to the following (abbreviated for clarity):

```shell
*   Trying 142.250.217.164:443...
* Connected to www.google.com (142.250.217.164) port 443 (#0)
* ALPN, offering h2
* ALPN, offering http/1.1
  ...
> GET / HTTP/2
> Host: www.google.com
> User-Agent: curl/7.74.0
> Accept: */*
>
* Connection state changed (MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS == 100)!
  < HTTP/2 200
  < content-type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1
```
```html
  ...
  <!doctype html><html itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/WebPage" lang="en"><head><meta content="Search the world's information, including webpages, images, videos and more. Google has many special features to help you find exactly what you're looking for." name="description"><meta content="noodp" name="robots">
  ...
```  

In the output, you can see the request headers (starting with GET / HTTP/2) and the response headers (starting with HTTP/2 200). The response body contains the HTML code of the Google homepage.

Keep in mind that curl is just one way to send HTTP requests. In programming languages like Python or JavaScript you would use special functions to send GET requests and process the responses.

### Here are some key aspects of HTTP:

**HTTP methods**: When your browser sends a request to a web server, it uses a specific HTTP method to indicate what it wants to do. The most common methods are:
- `GET`: Used to request data from the server (e.g., a web page, an image, or a video).
- `POST`: Used to submit data to the server (e.g., filling out a form or uploading a file).

**HTTP headers**: Both requests and responses contain HTTP headers, which provide additional information about the message. Headers include information like the type of web browser being used, the type of data being sent, and the date and time of the request.

**HTTP body**: The body of an HTTP message contains the actual data being sent. In a request, this could be the information you're submitting through a form. In a response, this is usually the web page, image, or video you requested.

**HTTP status codes**: When a web server sends a response, it includes a status code that indicates the outcome of the request. Some common status codes are:

- 200 OK: The request was successful, and the server has sent the requested data.
- 404 Not Found: The server couldn't find the requested resource (e.g., a missing web page or image).
- 500 Internal Server Error: The server encountered an error while processing the request.

Here's a simple example of an HTTP interaction between a browser and a web server:

You type "www.example.com" in your browser.

Your browser sends an HTTP request to the server with the following information:

Method: GET
URL: www.example.com
Headers: Information about your browser and the type of data you're requesting
The web server receives the request, processes it, and sends an HTTP response back to your browser with the following information:

Status code: 200 OK
Headers: Information about the server and the type of data being sent
Body: The HTML code for the web page you requested
Your browser receives the response, interprets the HTML code, and displays the web page on your screen.

In summary, HTTP is a set of rules that allows web browsers and web servers to communicate by sending requests and responses over the internet. It uses methods, headers, bodies, and status codes to ensure that both the browser and the server understand each other and can share information effectively.
