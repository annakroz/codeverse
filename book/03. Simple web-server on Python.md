# Simple Python Web Server Tutorial

In this tutorial, we'll learn how to create a simple web server using Python. We'll use the
http.server module from Python's standard library to achieve this. By the end of this tutorial,
you'll have a basic understanding of how to create and run a web server using Python.

Requirements:

- Python 3.x installed on your computer

## Step 1: Create a directory for your project

Create a new folder (directory) on your computer to store the files for this project. You can name
it something like simple-web-server.

## Step 2: Create a basic HTML file

In the simple-web-server directory, create a new file called index.html and add the following
content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Simple Web Server</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Hello, welcome to my simple web server!</h1>
<p>This is a basic HTML file served by a Python web server.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

This is a simple HTML file that will be served by our Python web server.

## Step 3: Create the Python web server script

In the same simple-web-server directory, create a new file called server.py and add the following
content:

```python
import http.server
import socketserver

# Define the handler to use for incoming requests
handler = http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler

# Define the port number for the server to listen on
port = 8080

# Create the server and bind it to the specified port
with socketserver.TCPServer(("", port), handler) as httpd:
    print(f"Serving on port {port}")

# Run the server forever
httpd.serve_forever()
```

This script creates a simple web server using the `http.server` module and sets it up to listen on
port `8080`.

> Think of a port as a room in a house, with the house representing your computer. When someone
> wants to communicate with your computer (the house), they need to know which room (port) to go to.
> Each room (port) can host a different service or application, and each one has a unique port number.
> In our case, our web server is using port 8080 as its room to listen for and process incoming
> requests. <br/> In our tutorial about the internet, we discussed how computers send messages to each
> other using IP addresses. Ports allow multiple services or applications to run on the same computer,
> each using a unique port number. In this case, our web server is using port 8080 to listen for and
> process incoming requests.

## Step 4: Run the web server

Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the simple-web-server directory, and run the
following command:

```bash
python server.py
```

You should see the following output:

```
Serving on port 8080
```

This means your web server is running and listening for incoming requests on port `8080`.

## Step 5: Access the web server in your browser

Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8080. You should see the content of the index.html
file displayed in your browser.

Congratulations! You've successfully created a simple Python web server that can serve HTML files.
To stop the web server, go back to your terminal or command prompt and press Ctrl + C.
